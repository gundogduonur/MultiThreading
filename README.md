# MultiThreading
### ArrayBlocking 
ArrayBlockingQueue class is a bounded blocking queue backed by an array. By bounded, it means that the size of the Queue is fixed. Once created, the capacity cannot be changed. Attempts to put an element into a full queue will result in the operation blocking.
### Thread Pools
A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers a solution to the problem of thread cycle overhead and resource thrashing. Since the thread is already existing when the request arrives, the delay introduced by thread creation is eliminated, making the application more responsive.
